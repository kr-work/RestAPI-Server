# New Server For Digital Curling

This is a new server for digital curling.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11 (or later)
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Gunicorn
- Pydantic
- SQLAlchemy

## Setup and Development

### Register user data to use basic authentication

This server use Basic authentication to identify client.
Basic authentication use username and password. Administrator can register user data in src/authentication/basic_authentication.py

```bash
cd ./src/authentication
python3 basic_authentication.py --username user --password password
```

### Start server

1. first you need to install docker and docker-compose, then pull this repository.

1. Please input this command at Linux or WSL.
    ```bash
    sudo sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=1
    ```

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

    ```bash
    POSTGRES_USER=your_user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
    POSTGRES_DB=your_db
    POSTGRES_HOST=your_host
    POSTGRES_PORT=your_port
    ```

1. Create docker network:

    ```bash
    docker network create dc_network
    ```

1. If you want to run dc-server in production env, run the following comman

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
    ```

1. If you want to run dc-server in development env, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
    ```

    In development mode, changes in the code will be reflected in the server automatically.

    If you don't want to see the logs, you can run the server in daemon mode with the `-d` flag.

## Communication through SSE

Board data is sent to the client by SSE.
When communication by SSE is disconnected, all board data within the end of the current match is sent to the client.
In this case, the old board data is divided into "**state_update**" in event.type and the latest board data into "**latest_state_update**" in event.type.

## For developpers

### Generate requirements.txt

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
```
